## Auto-Post and Auto-Reply

Threadstorm supports automation for both posting and replying to threads.

- **Auto-Post**:
  ```sh
  php bin/console app:threads auto-post 3-5
  ```
  This continuously posts 3-5 new threads in random intervals within a 24-hour timespan.

- **Auto-Reply**:
  ```sh
  php bin/console app:threads auto-reply
  ```
  This automatically scrapes and replies to comments on your own threads in random intervals between 15 and 300 minutes.

## Audit Functionality

To review automated activities:

```sh
php bin/console app:threads audit
```

You will be prompted to select either **Auto-Post** or **Auto-Reply** for audit review.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs, the CLI provides clear messages:

```sh
‚ùå A thread ID is required to retrieve a thread.
```

To troubleshoot, check your command syntax using `help`:

```sh
php bin/console app:threads help
```
